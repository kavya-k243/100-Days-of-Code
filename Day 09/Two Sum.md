Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.

1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.

2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.

Note: You are not allowed to use the same element twice. Example: If the target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Result: YES (for 1st variant)
       [1, 3] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: arr[1] + arr[3] = 14. So, the answer is “YES” for the first variant and [1, 3] for 2nd variant.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 15
Result: NO (for 1st variant)
	[-1, -1] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: There exist no such two numbers whose sum is equal to the target.
