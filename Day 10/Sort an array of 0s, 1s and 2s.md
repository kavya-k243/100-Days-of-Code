Problem Statement: Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Write a program to in-place sort the array without using inbuilt sort functions. ( Expected: Single pass-O(N) and constant space)

Examples
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
