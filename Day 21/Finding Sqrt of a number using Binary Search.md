Problem Statement: You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to find and return its square root. If ‘n’ is not a perfect square, then return the floor value of ‘sqrt(n)’.

Note: The question explicitly states that if the given number, n, is not a perfect square, our objective is to find the maximum number, x, such that x squared is less than or equal to n (x*x <= n). In other words, we need to determine the floor value of the square root of n.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: n = 36
Result: 6
Explanation: 6 is the square root of 36.

Example 2:
Input Format: n = 28
Result: 5
Explanation: Square root of 28 is approximately 5.292. So, the floor value will be 5.
