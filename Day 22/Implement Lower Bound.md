Problem Statement: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.

Pre-requisite: Binary Search algorithm

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 4, arr[] = {1,2,2,3}, x = 2
Result: 1
Explanation: Index 1 is the smallest index such that arr[1] >= x.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {3,5,8,15,19}, x = 9
Result: 3
Explanation: Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] >= x.
